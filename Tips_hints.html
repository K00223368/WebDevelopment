                <p>1. Make an excel sheet of your budget and the cost of all vendors and suppliers. Then make a seperate excel sheet with a list of all your guests. Both excel sheets will be utilised for the duration of the planning and up until the wedding day.      
                </p>
                
                <p>2. If you are booking a videographer and a photagrapher make sure you get a recommendation from a friend or someone who has booked them previously. I never booked a videographer because I felt that I would remember the whole day, I was extremely wrong. Book the videographer because the day goes so fast and I think because it is such a big day that it is very easy to forget. It is my one regret. This could be done by a family member with a hand held video recorder. This is just food for thought for anyone getting married. </p>
                
                <p>3.Don't do what I did. I never invited the priest to the meal. In my defence I assumed that they automatically came, I never realised that they needed an invitation. I know now!</p>
                
                <p>4.If you are getting married at Christmas or Easter you do not need to order flowers for the church as they will already be there. This will save a bit a money and can be budgeted towards something else. </p>
                
                <p>5. It is very important to go to bed at a reasonable hour the night before the big day. This will set you up for a long and very enjoyable day.</p>
                
                <p>6.Get comfortable shoes. I got a brand that I would normally use becuase they are comfortable but my shoes killed my feet and I will never wear them again.</p>
                
                <p>Don't forget to enjoy every minute of your day. You spent all that time planning it. Enjoy it.</p>
